Credits to @fitztrev for an excellent idea! Check the original PHP/Slack/Stripe version https://github.com/fitztrev/make-it-rain. This is a weekend rewrite using Ruby, plain old Rack, Braintree, Slack and Docker Cloud, that just brings make-it-rain awesomeness to any application by using containers. ðŸ™ƒ Get a random "make it rain" gif every time you get paid through Braintree!

Works with Slack and Braintree.

## How to use

1) Check out the Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/mrgrodo/make-it-rain/

2) Create a ["Successful Charge" webhook in Braintree](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/webhooks/overview)

2) Provide environment variables with your Braintree webhook and a Slack access token - `environment.rb` loads them all.
