## How to use

1) Copy `config.sample.php` to `config.php`

2) Update it with either your Hipchat or Slack API info (see below)

3) Add a webhook to [your Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks)

    https://YOUR_SITE_HERE.com/make-it-rain/webhook.php?secret=abc123

* Your `secret` is set in `config.php` and known only to Stripe so nobody can ping that URL and give you a false notification.

#### For Hipchat

1. Go to <https://hipchat.com/admin/rooms>
2. Click your room and copy "API ID" to the channel setting in `config.php`
3. In "Tokens" for that room, create a token with label "Just got paid" and copy it to `config.php`

#### For Slack

1. Go to <https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook>
2. Create a webhook for your desired channel
3. Copy the webhook URL to `config.php`
